### Short Summary:
My project is a personal portfolio page. Showing off my work as a designer and potentially developer.

### A code snippet I'm proud of: 
``` CSS
.floating-text {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: rgba(rgb(226, 224, 224), rgb(226, 224, 224), rgb(226, 224, 224), 0.8);
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
    position: absolute; 
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    font-size: 3rem;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-family: 'Mochiy Pop One', sans-serif;
    color: #000000;
    pointer-events: none;
    animation: glideToCenter 1s ease-out forwards; 
}
```
This is part of a bigger code but essentially, this CSS styles the text that shows up when transitioning between pages. It also blurs the entire page while the text is being shown. The blur part is what I'm most proud of.
